#### Installation
- using with Python3 recommended (Python3.4+)
- distributions will be installed automatically when installing Flask:
  - `Werkzeug` implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between applications and servers.
  - `Jinja` is a template language that renders the pages your application serves.
  - `MarkupSafe` comes with `Jinja`. It escapes untrusted input when rendering templates to avoid injection attacks.
  - `ItsDangerous` securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used to protect Flaskâ€™s session cookie.
  - `Click` is a framework for writing command line applications.
